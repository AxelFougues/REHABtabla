# What is La Tabla?

## Abstract

La Tabla is a magical table—put things on it and they come to life. Make music, play pong, design and play your own pinball tables, and create animations with your body, your friends, paper, drawings, game pieces—whatever strikes your fancy.

La Tabla is an experiment in making a computerized plaything that is radically embodied and open ended—ready to be playfully appropriated to new ends, and incorporate new materials. Paper, scissors, Go stones, Legos, pipe cleaner, food, your body—whatever you want—become the environments and raw materials used to make music, animate, and play games with bouncing balls like Pong and Pinball. La Tabla achieves this by combining computer vision, projection mapping, and design principles that anticipate and encourage open ended play and appropriation.
